        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>2014 -2016: Personal Assistant. Socialstyrelsen, Sweden.</h3>
        <p>I was in charge of patients with severe mental health issues (mostly schizophrenia combined with other illnesses). My job was to take care of them in every possible way, making them feel safe and protected from different stressors.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>2021 - 2023: Store Manager. Minimarket Keila, Quintero, Chile.</h3>
        <p>I had my own store and I managed every aspect of it. Unfortunately, the situation in Chile is quite bad for small business owners and I had to close. I took care of everything, from bookkeeping to logistics, so I can say I'm pretty well-rounded when it comes to managing something.</p>
